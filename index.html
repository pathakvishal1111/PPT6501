<p>Welcome! This is Analysis of Covid and Crimes. All analysis was conducted using Python 3.7. The code for this project is spread across three different Python Notebooks.</p>



<h2 id="scraping-and-processing-data">Abstract</h2>

<p>In Last 3 years the meaning of living a normal life has changed. The world which was used to hug and shake hands, moved to social distancing and elbow fists. To say, “The Pandemic has changed the world”, would be an understatement. It has reduced the impersonal meeting and increased the virtual existence of humans on internet. Pandemic has imposed the restrictions on everyday lives, thus effecting the people behavior. Pandemic has also affected the crime rates. In this study we intend to find the effects of covid on frequency of crime rates (includes violence, theft, murder, home abuse) in the United Kingdom (UK). Particularly, we will study the shift of crimes from one form to another across different states before and after covid. Secondly, we also want to figure out what are the factors which decide the outcome of the crime offender. We expect to use various data science visualizations techniques from analyzing the patterns of form & frequency change of crimes. For figuring out factors responsible for the outcomes of felony we intend to use various statistical Machine Learning, Statistical and Probabilistic techniques.</p>




<h2 id="findings-and-conclusions">Findings and Conclusions</h2>

<p>The project Gathered low level insights on the UK crime Data pre and post the pandemic of Covid. We were also able to figure out factors which can predict the outcome of the crime happened. The decent accuracy of models leads to good results and since they are boosted trees, so chances of over fitting is low. Results seem to be good but took a lot of time. Models seem to show expected result but since everything can be improved over time and it has been only one year of the pandemic data, with time data will evolve and patterns in the data will change as we need to take care of that as well. As the time will increase, we will also require high computational power with more stronger models. Results are easily interpretable and effective but if the data will increase, we must improve our baseline model with time for better results.</p>
